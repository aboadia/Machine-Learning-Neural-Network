Question 2 #1
I will use the identity activation function as my output activation function. I chose this because I want to keep my output or predicted value the same. 

Question 2 #2
Tere should be one output neuron for regression because we are not tryoing to map inputs to a variety of class labels, but rather by predicting a single continous target value for each sample.  

Question 2 #3

The average MSE loss for this modeel is 531.72 and its average Accuracy is 22.98.

Question 2 #4
Plotting the loss and accuracy as a function of the number of iterations:

Question 2 # 5
Varying the learning rate from 0.2 to 0.01 results: 
When the learning rate is changed from 0.2 to 0.01, the average mse decreased from 531 to 321. The accuracy decreased as well from 22.9 to 17.1.
